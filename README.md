### Allow myself to introduce ... myself ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ’¼ I ply my trade as a principal SRE leading a team responsible for the cloud platform enabling engineering to continuously deliver services to production.

âš¡ Fun fact: When not concerning myself about the *ilities of our platform, I sling a surprising amount of Bash and Make to grease the wheels of the SDLC.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

- Terraform gotchas, tips and tricks
- Homebrew private tap in Bitbucket

ðŸ˜Ž Outside work, find me road or gravel biking.
